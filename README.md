DISTRIBUTED-COMPUTING-ON-ANDROID
================================

The goal of this project was to create a distributed framework for performing a simple computation, on Android devices.
A central server should take a large computation and decompose it. Android devices will then be allowed to connect to the server.
Upon connecting, the devices will be assigned tasks to complete.
Then, upon completing the tasks, the results will be sent back to the server to be mapped.
A a distributed LU Decomposition was chosen to test the efficiency of the framework.
